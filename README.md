# WebMapper
An old web mapper that I wrote back in 2014.
The website is no longer live, but upon request, I would happily demo it.

It was a simple and to the point application. 
Comprised of a client application that searched webpages and shared completed work via a PHP API.
The website is a simple search main view that then leads to a floating node view of the website entered in the center and connecting websites as connected nodes.

Feel free to reuse code, and I am just uploading it in case anyone ever want to use it.

The website displayed nodes that could be clicked to expand connecting websites, at the time I was very happy with it, but looking back on it, there are big optimizations to be done.
